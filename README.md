# ABC Insurance Customer Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
## Background Story

ABC Insurance, previously a market leader, is facing a challenging trend of increasing customer churn while customer lifetime value remains stagnant or declines. The CEO emphasized the critical importance of understanding customers to address these trends effectively. The analysis in this project aims to identify patterns within customer data that could help revitalize ABC Insurance's customer engagement and product strategies, ultimately reducing churn and enhancing customer value.

- `ABC_df_demographics`: Contains demographic data like income, family status, home ownership, and credit ratings.
- `ABC_df_termination`: Lists customers who have suspended their policies, including the suspension dates.
